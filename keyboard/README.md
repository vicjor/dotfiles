# Keyboard Layout
Keyboard layout generated with [Ukelele](https://github.com/sillsdev/Ukelele). 

## Custom keys
Replaces all [dead keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key#:~:text=A%20dead%20key%20is%20a,the%20key%20struck%20immediately%20after.) with their "alive" equivalents. This means that e.g. when you type ~ you don't have to wait for another keyboard input, and the dead key won't merge with the second keyboard input. 

With these settings `~` + `o` will not output `õ`, but rather `~o`. This is particullary useful in the terminal where you often use `~` in the path, or in JavaScript when you make string literals. 

Modifications:
- ¨ to ~ 
- ´ to `
- Dead version of \` to alive version of \`
- Deadversion of ^ to alive version of ^
